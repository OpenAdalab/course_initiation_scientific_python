# Resources to go further

In this page you will find resources (course elements, chapters, online courses, videos, ...) that I have collected and assembled to facilitate your self-learning.

## Data Science

### Python programming

To find relevant resources according to your experience in python, please refer to **Chapter 2 of the Data Science course**.

### Object Oriented Programming in Python

If you want to learn more about object-oriented programming in Python, you can take these courses from Open Classrooms, depending on your needs:

- [easy level course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4302126-decouvrez-la-programmation-orientee-objet-avec-python)
- medium level course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/7150616-apprenez-la-programmation-orientee-objet-avec-python)

### Small courses

Recently the kaggle platform has set up mini courses with corrected exercises by chapters that are quick to do. These courses will allow you to discover some fundamental notions, that you will have the opportunity to dig deeper afterwards.

I advise you, according to your level of knowledge, and by order of priority to follow the following mini courses:

- learning [pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) the most used python module to manage tabular data
- introduction to [SQL basics](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) for database manipulation. Optionally, you can go further, exploring more advanced [SQL language features](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql), including learning how to combine multiple tables
- learn the [basic principles of data cleansing](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) and can complete your knowledge by testing [machine learning methods for data pre-processing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-data) by exploring the dedicated menu of the sckit-learn framework. To go even further, you can test [semi-supervised learning algorithms for automatic data labeling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/label_propagation.html#semi-supervised) of the same framework
- finally you can finish your learning of the basics by studying [feature engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)

### Course elements by theme

#### Algorithms
You can discover the [practical basics of algorhythmics with this Open Classroom course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1467201-algorithmique-pour-lapprenti-programmeur/1467409-un-peu-de-pratique ). I advise you to focus in particular on the chapters concerning data structures *files, lists and trees*.

### Complete French courses 

The following courses are very complete courses that are given in masters specialized in data science. You probably won't have the time to explore them completely, I advise you to refer to them only when you need to go deeper into a specific topic or to look for additional exercises

- the SISE master course of Lyon 2 dedicated to data science and data mining, in particular the c[ours de mise à niveau](http://tutoriels-data-mining.blogspot.com/p/sise.html), which I particularly recommend if you have done little math and computer science (in particular python)
- the [data science module of the ENSAE course](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx3/projet_info_2A.html#data-scientist) in Paris
