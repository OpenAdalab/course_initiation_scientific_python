# Lexicon of important concepts

*Preamble: This glossary contains the essential concepts that you will sometimes need during this course. In fact, some definitions are simplified to make them easier to understand, but you can consult the resources cited for more details. I tried to synthesize and illustrate as much as possible each definition, for more precision, don't hesitate to ask me about the subject or to complete these notions by your own research*.  

## Computer science

### Programming paradigms

- **[Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)** is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm), that involves implementing the behavior of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) as [procedures (a.k.a. functions, subroutines)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)) that call each other. The resulting program is a series of steps that forms a hierarchy of calls to its constituent procedures.
- **[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)** (**OOP**) is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) based on [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) – [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) entities that [encapsulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(programming)) [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) and [function(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)). An OOP [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) consists of objects that interact with one another
- **[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)** is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) where programs are constructed by [applying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_application) and [composing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)). It is a [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) paradigm in which function definitions are [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) of [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) that map [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) to other values

###  Langages

- [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) (alternatively **assembler language** or **symbolic machine code** and commonly abbreviated as **ASM** or **asm**) is a [low-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) that helps to communicate directly with computer hardware. It uses very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the [architecture's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture) [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture).
